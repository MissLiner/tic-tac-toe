--DEVELOPMENT--

This game was designed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as part of the Odin Project Javascript curriculum. 
I struggled for days with creating modules for the Gameboard and Controller. This was a great opportunity 
to *finally* learn how to ask for help on the Odin Project Discord server. There I learned more about 
"getter functions", enabling me to preserve my changing private variable values, and make them available
across modules.

Once the Javascript was in working order, I used:

    *Adobe Illustrator - to create a custom star background
    *color.adobe.com - to create a custom color palette
    *fontspace.com - to create the title "Tic-Tac-Toe" image with the 2Peas 4th of July font
        (I used Adobe Illustrator to change the font color, and make the stars white)

For the last stage, I worked on making sure that the layout looked clean, worked at different sizes, and 
the appropriate buttons and info were available when needed. I look forward to my next project, as I'd
like to put more thought into where (and when) each element should be placed BEFORE I've created and
styled them all :)

--FUTURE UPDATES--

Potential future development paths include:
    1. Creating an AI to play against
    2. Optimizing for mobile and smaller screens
    3. Creating more options for player markers
